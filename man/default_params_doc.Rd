documentation.}
\usage{
default_params_doc(dt, phylogenies, step_type, time_unit)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{The timestep resolution,
a value bigger than zero and less or equal to one.
1/dt is the number of points that will be evaluated}

\item{phylogenies}{a collection of one or more phylogenies,
where the phylogenies are of type \link[ape]{phylo}.
This collection can both be a list of \link[ape]{phylo} or
a \link[ape]{multiphylo}.}

\item{step_type}{when between two points, where the second point
 has both a higher x and y coordinat, which y coordinat to follow.
'step_type' can be:
\itemize{
   \item lower maintain the y-coordinat of the leftmost point
   \item upper already use the y-coordinat of the rightmost point
}}

\item{time_unit}{the time unit of the branching times
\itemize{
 \item{"ago: "}{the branching times are postive,
   as these are in time units ago}
 \item{"since: "}{the branching times are negative,
   as these are in time units since present}
}}

\description{
This function does nothing. It is intended to inherit is parameters'
documentation.
}
\note{
This is an internal function, so it should be marked with
  \code{@noRd}. This is not done, as this will disallow all
  functions to find the documentation parameters
