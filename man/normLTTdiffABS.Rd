\title{
  Calculate the absolute difference between two normalized Lineage-Through-Time curves, given two phylogenetic trees.
}
\description{
  This function takes two ultrametric phylogenetic trees, calculates the normalized Lineage-Through-Time statistic for both trees and then calculates the absolute difference between the two statistics.
}
\usage{
normLTTdiffABS(tree1, tree2)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{tree1}{
an object of class \code{"phylo"};

}
  \item{tree2}{
an object of class \code{"phylo"};

}
}
\value{
The absolute difference between the two nLTT statistics
