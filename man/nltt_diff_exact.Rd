\title{Calculates the exact, difference between the lineage through time
curves of tree1 & tree2 (normalized in time and for the number of lineages)}

\arguments{
\item{tree1}{(phylo) First phylogenetic tree}

\item{tree2}{(phylo) Second phylogenetic tree}

\item{distance_method}{(string) absolute, or squared distance?}

\item{ignore_stem}{(logical) Should the phylogeny its stem be ignored?}
}
\value{
(scalar) normalized Lineage-Through-Time difference
  between tree1 & tree2
}
